 Adding political party affiliation to the state_abbreviations table As of 2025
 Also Adding Regions to this table.
 
 Trifecta: A trifecta occurs when one party controls the governorâ€™s office and both legislative chambers (House and Senate).
 
 I realised as I was developing this example that I needed to add a category to group on for aggregating the data.
 To accomodate I added a new column POLI_AFFILIATION and REGION to the state_abbreviations table.
